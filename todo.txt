llm query dsl
  toturial doc
    architecture
      pipeline, data flow, expressions
    very common components
      obj,list,dataTest,equals,contains,join
    more components ...


llm
  add token count and $$cost (using pricing and model)
  add nodejs support

llm document assistant for *items*
  *** it is a very good idea beacuse there are many documents it learned from
  goal: generate qaulity items content. E.g. tutorial
  suggest items types and items structure
  build adaptive studio for generating content for each item type
  content sources
    DB, apis, internet
  content improvement process - working on the template UIs
    content quailty marks
    content quailty cretria
    optinal
      generating content alternatives
      merging quality from the alternatives
    item specific quality measurement
    item specific examples to improve from

llm document assistant for jbart widget tutorial
  top down design - starting from json
  defining target audience
  content depth, length, recursiveness
  importance of each data part for summary
  summary versus details
  shown versus expandable

use widget tutorial to train specialized models
use trained models to be experts in item content generation

fix rx dsl


references
  when stand on params: [ { id: 'dd' }]
tests
  run tests on node
  unify tests - jbmTest.cmd*

name refactor
  watchRef - second param byName

unify contains, equal, endsWith, startsWith - %% - allText, text -> data, maybe 'data' param by name can be standard!!

chatgpt
  generate css for htmls
  use chatgpt to plan a view of a context for a specific need and target audience.
  use rules

  generate python
  tgp wrapper for libraries
  external lib version, add version to using and pluginDsl - find use case with external lib

go over UIFrontEndTest and try to make it uiTest
load plugin dynamically in probeTest
ctrl-I
  add plugin and file info about 'using' and 'dsl' indication for current plugin
add plugin dependencies chart with code side and #components

controlWithFeatures - use ctx params in features
vdom diff bug!!!
 uiTest.tableTreeUnexpandRefresh.vdom
vscode
  preview mode - 
    two phase - calc the circuit and run preview on the circuit

tests to fix
  uiTest.editableText.richPicklistHelper.setInput
  remoteWidgetTest.runInBECmpContext

remote logs should be added to log in general (in cmd)
  how to merge?
    1. just add a new log line starting with 'source:xx 
  remote errors should be added to current log
add circuit selection to ctrl-I
add disabled (like remark)

- implement private comps - jb.component has plugin. jb.run will try jb.utils.getPlugin(profile).comps[fullId] || jb.comps[fullId],
jb.exec({$: 'mukki', $plugin: 'studio' })
idea: { $: 'button', $plugin :'ui@5.2' at the json } allow multiple version simulatinously for conversion

zui gridView
  build manual test
  calc relative zoom and center
  integrate layout
  present elems
  lazy elem preparation
zui BE-FE
  rewrite itemlist to separate FE and BE features
    each view may need help beacuse of the props
