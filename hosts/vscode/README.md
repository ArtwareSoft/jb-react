# Visual Development

Visual development was broken in the world of web development, mostly because pre-defined visual components could not be re-used anymore.
The industry de-facto accepts the fact that complex web apps can **not** be developed visually.

jBart suggests a revolutionary approach for visual development of complex apps that actually works,
and jBart studio was developed with jBart.
