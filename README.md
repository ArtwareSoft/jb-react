# Visual Development with React

Visual development was broken in the world of web development, mostly because pre-defined visual components could not be re-used anymore.
The industry de-facto accepts the fact that complex web apps can **not** be developed visually.

jBart suggests a revolutionary approach for visual development of complex apps that actually works.

## Install
- mkdir myProj
- cd myProj
- npm init (answer Enter to use defaults)

- node ./node_modules/jbart5-react/bin/studio/studio-server.js
- goto 'http://localhost:8083/studio-bin'
- create a new project
- enjoy..


## Visual Development Concepts
- pick & edit (like in Chrome debugger)
- work by example data
- smart data/code guidance in context
- preserve the full power of react & javascript

## Visual Development Benefits
- faster delivery
- enhance quality
- reduce development/maintenance costs
- less technical people can build complex business apps
- develop larger projects
- enhance team work effectiveness

## jBart is written by itself
- core is written in react
- studio is written by itself (like the C compiler written in C)

## code completion - convert jBart components to typescript interfaces
add the following line to your package json "scripts" section to generate typescript definition file that will allow you autocomplete.
